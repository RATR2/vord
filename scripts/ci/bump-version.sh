# A real PAT doesn't have that restriction, but actions/checkout leaves a
# persistent `http.https://github.com/.extraheader` Authorization header (its
# own GITHUB_TOKEN) in the local git config for the whole job, and that header
# applies to ANY https://github.com/... URL regardless of embedded userinfo,
# silently overriding the PAT in the URL below. `-c http...extraheader=`
# clears it for just this invocation so the PAT is what actually authenticates.
